# pop_synth

A repo with easy-to-use functions to quickly create a population synthesis of SMBHBs based on the model of Middleton et al. 2016.

Can be modified to use for any gravitational wave background that is formed by a finite population of GW emitters.

Contains functions to compute the analytical mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a GWB spectrum across realisations of finite populations given a model for the population of emitters.

Used in Lamb & Taylor 2024 [arXiv:2407.06270](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06270)
